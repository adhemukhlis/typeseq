# TypeSeq

**TypeSeq** provides a compact, deterministic serialization for flat objects by embedding type information directly into the encoded output.
It supports strings, numbers, booleans, and dates, preserves type fidelity on decode, and offers optional schema-based decoding for full TypeScript safety.
